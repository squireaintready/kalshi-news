    <h1>About Prediction Pulse</h1>

    <div class="about-content">
        <p class="lead">Prediction Pulse surfaces the news stories that people are actually putting money on. When real dollars are at stake, you get a clearer picture of what the world thinks will happen.</p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Traditional news tells you what happened. Prediction markets tell you what people <em>expect</em> to happen—and they're willing to bet on it. We track these markets and translate them into readable stories about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Politics</strong> — Elections, policy changes, appointments</li>
            <li><strong>Economy</strong> — Fed decisions, inflation, interest rates</li>
            <li><strong>World Events</strong> — Geopolitics, treaties, international relations</li>
            <li><strong>Tech & Culture</strong> — IPOs, product launches, industry shifts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>We continuously monitor prediction markets to find the stories with real momentum. Our AI analyzes the odds, trading volume, and price movements to write clear, conversational coverage of what's happening and why it matters.</p>

        <h2>What the Numbers Mean</h2>
        <p>When you see "73% YES" on a story, that means traders collectively believe there's a 73% chance that event will happen. The more money behind a prediction, the more confidence the crowd has.</p>
