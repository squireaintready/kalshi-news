    <h1>About Prediction Pulse</h1>

    <div class="about-content">
        <p>Prediction Pulse automatically tracks trending prediction markets on <a href="https://kalshi.com" target="_blank">Kalshi</a> and generates conversational analysis articles about what's moving and why.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Every hour, our system:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fetches the most active and interesting prediction markets from Kalshi</li>
            <li>Analyzes the current odds, volume, and market movement</li>
            <li>Generates a conversational breakdown of what's happening and what to watch</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What Makes a Market "Trending"?</h2>
        <p>We score markets based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Volume</strong> — More trading means more interest</li>
            <li><strong>Uncertainty</strong> — Markets with odds between 20-80% are more interesting</li>
            <li><strong>Recent movement</strong> — Price swings indicate developing stories</li>
            <li><strong>Time to close</strong> — Markets about to resolve get priority</li>
        </ul>
